	Self-intersection in surfaces is a typical defect that makes a 3D model unsuitable for many applications. 
	Existing neural networks for 3D surface mesh reconstruction has the challenge of integrating self-intersection prevention in their unidirectional frameworks.
	In this paper, we propose to use cycle regularization as a self-intersection prevention technique for mesh reconstruction networks.
	It is a general technique that can be implemented with networks for generating meshes from single color image. Our experiments on two latest mesh reconstruction networks demonstrates that with the proposed cycle regularization, self-intersections in the generated meshes are significantly reduced, while the distance between the generated surfaces with ground-truth is on par with original networks.
