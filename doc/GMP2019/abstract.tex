	Self-intersection in surfaces is a typical defect that makes a 3D model unsuitable for many applications. 
	Existing neural networks for 3D surface mesh reconstruction have the challenge of integrating self-intersection prevention in their unidirectional frameworks.
	In this paper, we propose a trainable cycle regularization in mesh reconstruction networks to prevent self-intersection.
	It is a general technique that can be implemented with networks for generating meshes from a single color image. Our experiments on two latest mesh reconstruction networks demonstrates that with the proposed cycle regularization, self-intersections in the generated meshes are significantly reduced, while the distance between the generated surfaces with ground-truth is on par with original networks.
