\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we propose the cycle regularization technique for preventing surface self-intersections in generic surface mesh reconstruction networks. The cycle regularization technique reduces self-intersections by enforcing injectivity in neural networks. It stems from the basic injectivity decision theorem and enforces injectivity by simultaneously learning an inverse mapping along with original mapping. It is quite simple to implement with existing mesh generation networks. Our experiments on two latest mesh generation networks prove that our technique is effective for reducing self-intersections in the generated meshes.
