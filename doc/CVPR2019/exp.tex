\section{Experiments}

\noindent{\textbf{Data}}
\todo{explain the data we use in experiment}

\noindent{\textbf{Evaluation criteria}}
\todo{we need to find a criteria different from Chamfer distance, which can show the advantage of our technique, i.e. our mesh have less self-intersection or self-overlap  }
\subsection{Effect of cycle regularization}

\todo{train and test atlasnet with and without cycle regularization}

\todo{train and test Pixel2Mesh with and without cycle regularization}

\subsection{Shape Interpolation}

\todo{visualize the shape morphing for AtlasNet and Pixel2Mesh with and without cycle regularization}

\subsection{Cycle regularization for parameterization optimization}
\todo{implement cycle regularization for classic parameterization optimization and shape deformation to show that it is a general regularization technique that can be used beyond training neural networks}
\subsection{Cycle regularization for shape deformation}
