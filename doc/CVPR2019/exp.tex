\section{Experiments}

\noindent{\textbf{Data}} To show the effect of cycle regularization we use the data released by AtlasNet and Pixel2Mesh respectively \cite{3DR2N2}
\todo{explain the data we use in experiment}

\noindent{\textbf{Evaluation criteria}}
In order to quantitatively evaluate the issue of self-intersection and self-overlap, we count the percentage of self-intersected triangles on the surface over the total number of triangles. We also use the value of Chamfer distance (``CD") as the original AtlasNet and Pixel2Mesh to evaluate how well the generated mesh approximate the target shape.
