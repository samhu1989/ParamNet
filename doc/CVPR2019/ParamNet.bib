	abstract="Shape deformation requires expert user manipulation even when the object under consideration is in a high fidelity format such as a 3D mesh. It becomes even more complicated if the data is represented as a point set or a depth scan with significant self occlusions. We introduce an end-to-end solution to this tedious process using a volumetric Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that learns deformation flows in 3D. Our network architectures take the voxelized representation of the shape and a semantic deformation intention (e.g., make more sporty) as input and generate a deformation flow at the output. We show that such deformation flows can be trivially applied to the input shape, resulting in a novel deformed version of the input without losing detail information. Our experiments show that the CNN approach achieves comparable results with state of the art methods when applied to CAD models. When applied to single frame depth scans, and partial/noisy CAD models we achieve                                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}sim {\}}60{\backslash},{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}                   less error compared to the state-of-the-art.",

Current paradigms to tackle this challenge are to either adapt the convolutional filters to operate on surfaces, learn spectral descriptors defined by the Laplace-Beltrami operator, or to drop surfaces altogether in lieu of voxelized inputs. Here we adopt an approach of converting the 3D shape into a `geometry image' so that standard CNNs can directly be used to learn 3D shapes. We qualitatively and quantitatively validate that creating geometry images using authalic parametrization on a spherical domain is suitable for robust learning of 3D shape surfaces. This spherically parameterized shape is then projected and cut to convert the original 3D shape into a flat and regular geometry image. We propose a way to implicitly learn the topology and structure of 3D shapes using geometry images encoded with suitable features. We show the efficacy of our approach to learn 3D shape surfaces for classification and retrieval tasks on non-rigid and rigid shape datasets.",

	abstract="There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

	abstract="What is a good vector representation of an object? We believe that it should be generative in 3D, in the sense that it can produce new 3D objects; as well as be predictable from 2D, in the sense that it can be perceived from 2D images. We propose a novel architecture, called the TL-embedding network, to learn an embedding space with these properties. The network consists of two components: (a) an autoencoder that ensures the representation is generative; and (b) a convolutional network that ensures the representation is predictable. This enables tackling a number of tasks including voxel prediction from 2D images and 3D model retrieval. Extensive experimental analysis demonstrates the usefulness and versatility of this embedding.",

	abstract="A central goal for visual perception is the recovery of the three-dimensional structure of the surfaces depicted in an image. Crucial information about three-dimensional structure is provided by the spatial distribution of surface markings, particularly for static monocular views: projection distorts texture geometry in a manner tha depends systematically on surface shape and orientation. To isolate and measure this projective distortion in an image is to recover the three dimensional structure of the textured surface. For natural textures, we show that the uniform density assumption (texels are uniformly distributed) is enough to recover the orientation of a single textured plane in view, under perspective projection. Furthermore, when the texels cannot be found, the edges of the image are enough to determine shape, under a more general assumption, that the sum of the lengths of the contours on the world plane is about the same everywhere. Finally, several experimental results for synthetic and natural images are presented.",

@misc{adam,
	abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization
	of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order
	moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally
	efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling
	of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of
	data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary
	objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The
	hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little
	tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are
	discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the
	algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable
	to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework.
	Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares
	favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax,
	a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

With carefully chosen approximations and a separable representation, novel closed-form formulas for the surface orientation in terms of texture gradients are derived. On top of this model, we propose a SfT algorithm based on spatial derivatives of the dominant local spatial frequency in the source image. The method is motivated geometrically and it is justified rigorously by error estimates. The reliability of the algorithm is evaluated by synthetic and real world experiments.",

	The objective of this paper is to estimate the orientation of a scene plane from an uncalibrated perspective image under the assumption that the scene is coated with a homogeneous (but unknown) texture. We make the following novel contributions: first, we show that the problem is equivalent to estimating the vanishing line of the plane; second, we show that estimating the two degrees of freedom of this line can be decomposed into two searches each for one parameter; third, we give an algorithm for this estimation which is applicable to both regular and irregular textures. The algorithms do not require that texels are identified explicitly. But once the plane vanishing line has been obtained, then texels locations can be determined, and the geometry of the scene plane computed up to an affine transformation. We give examples of these computations on real images.
