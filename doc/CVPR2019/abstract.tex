	Self-intersection in surfaces is a typical defect that makes a 3D model unsuitable for many applications. 
	Existing neural networks for 3D mesh reconstruction has the challenges of integrating self-intersection prevention in their unidirectional frameworks.
	In this paper, we propose to use cycle regularization as a self-intersection prevention technique for mesh reconstruction networks.
	It is flexible to integrate into networks for generating meshes. Our experiments on two latest mesh reconstruction networks demonstrates that the proposed cycle regularization can effectively reduce the self-intersection in generated mesh while remains similar discrepancy with target surface
