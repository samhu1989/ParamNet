	Self-intersection in surfaces is a typical defect that makes a 3D model unsuitable for many applications. 
	Existing neural networks for 3D mesh reconstruction has the challenges of integrating self-intersection prevention in their unidirectional frameworks.
	In this paper, we propose to use cycle regularization as a self-intersection prevention technique for mesh reconstruction networks.
	It is flexible to integrate into networks for generating meshes. Our experiments on two latest mesh reconstruction networks demonstrates that with the proposed cycle regularization, the generated meshes' self-intersection are effectively reduced and   discrepancy to target surface are kept similar as original networks.
