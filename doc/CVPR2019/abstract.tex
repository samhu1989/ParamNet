	Self-intersection in surfaces is a typical defect that makes a 3D model unsuitable for many applications. 
	Existing neural networks for 3D surface mesh reconstruction has the challenge of integrating self-intersection prevention in their unidirectional frameworks.
	In this paper, we propose to use cycle regularization as a self-intersection prevention technique for mesh reconstruction networks.
	It is a general technique to implement with networks for generating meshes. Our experiments on two latest mesh reconstruction networks demonstrates that with the proposed cycle regularization, the generated meshes' self-intersection are significantly reduced and discrepancy to target surface are kept comparable to original networks.
