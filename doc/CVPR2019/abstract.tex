	In this paper, we address a specific issue of surface self-intersection for some of the latest 3D mesh reconstruction networks. We propose a cycle regularization technique to train these networks, preventing surface self-intersection for the generated mesh. It is extremely easy to implement given an existing 3D surface mesh reconstruction network as AtlasNet\cite{atlasnet} and Pixel2Mesh\cite{pixel2mesh}. We explain the mathematics foundation of the proposed technique and prove its effectiveness for this issue in experiment.
