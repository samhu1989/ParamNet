	In this paper, we address a specific issue of surface self-intersection for some of the latest 3D mesh reconstruction networks. We propose an inversive regularization technique to train these networks while preventing surface self-intersection for the generated mesh. We explain the mathematics foundation of the proposed technique and prove its effectiveness for this issue in experiment.
